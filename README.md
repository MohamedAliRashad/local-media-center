## Overview

This media center environment includes popular applications such as Jellyfin, Radarr, Sonarr, and others for managing and accessing media collections. Nginx is configured as a reverse proxy to simplify access to each service via easy-to-remember routes.

## Features

- **Media Streaming**: Stream movies, TV shows, and other media with Jellyfin.
- **Automated Media Management**: Use Radarr, Sonarr, and other tools to automatically download, organize, and tag media files.
- **Subtitle Management**: Bazarr is configured for automatic subtitle downloads.
- **Torrent and Usenet Support**: qBittorrent and Sabnzbd offer flexible download options.
- **Single Access Point**: Access all services via a single IP address with customizable endpoints.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose installed
- NVIDIA GPU (optional for hardware acceleration with Jellyfin)
- Environment variables set up (place these in a `.env` file in the root of this project):
  ```plaintext
  PUID=1000
  PGID=1000
  TZ=Europe/London
  MEDIA_CENTER_PATH=/path/to/your/media_center
  ```

### Steps
1. **Clone this repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/local-media-center.git
   cd local-media-center
   ```

2. **Update Environment Variables**:
   Modify the `.env` file to match your system's configuration.

3. **Run Docker Compose**:
   Start the containers using Docker Compose:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

4. **Access the Services**:
   Open your browser and navigate to `http://your-server-ip` (or use Nginx-configured paths to access each service).

## Configuration

### Reverse Proxy (Nginx)
Nginx is configured to serve each application at a specific path (e.g., `/jellyfin`, `/radarr`). The `nginx.conf` file in this repository defines these paths and ensures smooth navigation across all services.

### Volumes and Paths
The following paths should be configured to match your media and configuration locations:
- **Media Storage**: `${MEDIA_CENTER_PATH}/media/movies`, `${MEDIA_CENTER_PATH}/media/tv`
- **Configuration Files**: `${MEDIA_CENTER_PATH}/config/{service_name}`
- **Download Directory**: `${MEDIA_CENTER_PATH}/downloads`

## Available Services

Each service runs in its own container and can be accessed through the Nginx reverse proxy:

| Service       | Path         | Port | Description                                |
|---------------|--------------|------|--------------------------------------------|
| Jellyfin      | `/jellyfin`  | 8096 | Media server for streaming media           |
| Jellyseerr    | `/jellyseerr`| 5055 | Request management for Jellyfin            |
| Radarr        | `/radarr`    | 7878 | Manages movie downloads and organization   |

| Prowlarr      | `/prowlarr`  | 9696 | Integrates with indexers for Radarr/Sonarr |
| Bazarr        | `/bazarr`    | 6767 | Automated subtitle management              |

| Sabnzbd       | `/sabnzbd`   | 8080 | Usenet client for managing downloads       |

### Optional Services
Commented-out services in `docker-compose.yml` include:
- **Tdarr**: For video transcoding and optimization (requires an NVIDIA GPU).
- **Ngrok**: Expose the server securely via the web for remote access.

## Accessing the Applications

Each service is accessible via Nginx using predefined routes. Access each application by appending its path to the serverâ€™s IP address or hostname:

- **Example**: `http://your-server-ip/jellyfin` for Jellyfin
- **Homarr Homepage**: A landing page for all services, accessible at `http://your-server-ip/`
